# System Design

## System Architecture Overview:

![System Overview](diagrams/System%20Overview.png)
*Fig 1: A minimalistic over view of how the system will work.*

1. ***Field Client(Mobile, Flutter):*** Offline app for plot-capture, photos, solid samples, geotagging, local signing, and queued upload.
2. ***Uploader/Drone CLI(Python):*** Uploads orthomasaics/DEM/multispectral imagery+metadata.
3. ***Ingestion Service(FastAPI):*** Validates uploads, stores metadata, places files in object store and IPFS, enquires MRV jobs.
4. ***MRV compute pipeline(Python,Airflow/Celery):*** Executes methodology: allometry, soil carbon, remote-sensing analysis, uncertainty calculations; outputs dataset, PDF report and JSON package.
5. ***Storage:***  
   1. _Postgres+PostGIS_ : vector & tabular geodata.
   2. _MinIO/S3_: large objects(images, orthomosaics).
   3. _IPFS:_ Immutable MRV package pinning and CIDs.
6. ***Blockchain layer(Hyperledger Besu/Quorum):*** Permissioned EVM for registry, MRV commits and ERC-1155 token insuarance; optionalanchoring to polygon.
7. ***Smart Contract(Solidity):*** Registry, MRVCommit, Credit 1155, Bufferproof, AccessControl.
8. ***Web UI(Next.js):*** Admin, proponent, verifier, buyer dashboards and public explorer.
9. ***Identuty & Auth:*** OICD for web flows, wallet based signin for provenance.
10. ***Marketplace / Retirement Service:*** Optional marketplace and retirement certificate generator.
11. ***Monitoring / DevOps:*** K8s, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, CI/CD.

## Logical Data Workflow:

![Data Flow System Design](diagrams/Data%20Flow%20System%20Design.jpg)
*Fig 2: Logical data flow system design*

### 1. Project Registration:

- Regristration of project via wen UI -> submits polygon, tenure docs, methodology id.
- Backend stores project record in Postgre and docs to MinIO, and then stored in IPFS.

### 2. Data Capture:

- Data collection from Field User(Mobile App).
- Data Collection from Drone(Python CLI).

### 3. Ingestion & Storage:

- Respective project details sotored in respective project number.
- Validates signatures, persists files to MinIO and metadata to Postgres.
- Send data in queue for MRV verification.

### 4. MRV Compute:

- Pull relevant files, runs calculations, produces results.json, report.pdf.
- Builds merkle tree over dataset to compute Merkle root verification.
- Pin MRV bunde to IPFS -> get cid.
- stores it in database.

### 5. Verification:

- Verifier reviews via verifier dashboard; reruns calculations using provided scripts, to check the data uniqueness and result validity.
- Verifier signs approval (ECDSA signature) and uploads verified package.

### 6. On-chain MRV commit:

- Verifier commits the verified MRV bundle by calling the submitVerifiedMRV(projectID, vintage, merkleroor, cid, verifierSig) on the registry contract.
- Contract will validate Verifier role and emits MRVCommitted event.

### 7: Issance:

- NCCR admin calls mintCredits(projectID, vintage, qty) -> ERC-1155 tokens minted and buffer allocation done.

### 8: Trade/Retirement:
- Tokens transfered via standard ERC-1155 methods.
- To reture: retire(tokenId, qty, beneficiary, purpose, certCID)

## Database Design:

![Blockchain MRV Database Design](diagrams/Blockchain%20MRV%20Database%20Design.jpg)
*Fig 3: Database Design*

### 1. users table:

- contain user details.
- a unique user_id generated by backend.
- user wallet but app side field signature.

### 2. projects table

- contains the details of of the generated project with an unique 32byte crypto id.
- contains all the project description and tenure docs, important for legal identification.
- connected to the users table for user work reference.

### 3. fields_bundle table
- contains the fiels data specifications for the next steps and validation.
- provides critical dataset for MVR calculations.

### 4. mvr_jobs table:

- contains the processed results of the MVR process.
- critical dataset for logic revalidation.
- important for user verification.

### 5. verification table:
- contained the verifier id & crypto signature which is very important for validation and trust in carbon market
- cruicial step for mvr logic checking
- last checkup before filling it to registry

### 6. blockchain_commits:
- contains the details of the blockchain upload.
- important for registry logs.
- generate the last crypto sigature and the final stage of validation.

## API Workflow:

![API Schema](diagrams/api%20Schema.jpg)
*Fig 4: API Schema*

This diagram is the visual representation of the backend API, which will control all the flows of the project.

***Carbon API*** marks the entry point of the api.

### /auth
Is the branch which will control the authetication for project registry, signups and front-end token verifications for both mobile and website for different kinds of users like: field-worker, verifier, admin, buyer.

***/authsignin*** controls the signin protocol.
***/authsignup*** controls the signup protocol.
***/authenticate*** controls the token verification protocol.

### /projects
Controls the project registration on the front-end side.

***/createProject*** create a new project for a specific user.
***/deleteProject*** delete a project.
***/listProjects*** list the projects based on input parameters, important for admin panel.

### /ingestion
handles the data merge from app and drone as well as a cerntain level of data validity and stores it in the database 

### mrvController
Is a family of method regimes which will calculate the carbon count based on the field data and will store the result in the database. It is called automatically when data is available in pipeline.

### /verification
It is the semi-manual api which depends on the manual user content to validate the project with validator crypto id.

### Solidity Contracts
This looks after the data registry on the permissioned besu blockchain, controls auth, gets registry data, etc.

This is an overall system design of the Blue-Carbon blockchain project.
